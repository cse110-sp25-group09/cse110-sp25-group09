# Meeting: Retrospective Meeting 1

## Start Time: 1:36pm

## Attendance Travis, Trisha, Rosario, Tri, Charon, Ahmed, Taha, Brenden, Pratham, Vincent

## Sprint Number: 1

## What Went Good:
 - goals seemed to be met good, very satisfying progress
 - agile updates went pretty good

## What to Improve:
 - communication and attendance
 - pull requests (low priority) but some sat for awhile
 - more consistent agile updates
 - emphasis on meeting attendance so we know how to move forward together
 - may want to look at monday-thursday turn around, felt very fast
 - consistent meeting spot, maybe reserve?
 - keep planner updated for project

## How We Are Gonna Improve:
 - Some members seem to be missing often so more consistent attendance communication moving forward
 - We will start trying to reserve spots in the library
 - We will list all meetings for the week somewhere.
    - Mondays (zoom): 9pm - 10:30pm
    - Thursday (library): 1pm-3pm (possible 1:30pm start)
    - Sunday (zoom): 1pm-2pm review and retrospective

## General Notes:
 - if we go on our own slack it might be good to make a bot for our agile reminders
 - thoughts of moving thursday meeting time to 1:30pm

## End Time: 2:07pm
