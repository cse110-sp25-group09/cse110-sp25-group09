# Use of JSDoc for Automated Documentation



## Feature
We have decided to use **JSDoc** for documentation automation. JSDoc allows us to embed documentation directly within our JS files using specially formatted comments. We will include a script in our CI pipeline to automatically generate HTML documentation files whenever we push changes to the repository.
This decision ensures:
- Developers write documentation as they code
- Our docs remain updated with minimal manual work
- Non-developers and new team members can get up to pace with the generated HTML docs
