# Biome for Linting
### Feature
 - Acts as all in one tool that formats, lints code, and more.
 - Written in Rust for high performance so reduces overall build and CI/CD pipeline times.
 - Catches early errors in code before sending to build to prevent errors
# Pros:
- Code quality will be high with this enabled.
- We will have fewer errors in our production code
- The build and pipelines times will still stay low to allow for faster testing
# Cons
- As it is a tool we have not used earlier, setup is trickier
- However, we have added it will ensure it works with test this week
