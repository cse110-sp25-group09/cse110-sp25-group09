# Code Quality via Human Review
### Feature
 - We will be using pull requests in combination with branch protection rules to make sure that code is being checked by a human
 - Also to the branch protection rule, we added that 2 people have to confirm the code before it is able to be pushed to the main branch, along with making sure the unit tests pass
