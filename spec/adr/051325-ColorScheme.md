# Chose Color Scheme Shown In Figma
### We have the hex codes for our color scheme saved, mainly dark blue, light blue, white, and orange, which is reflected in our design.
 - We mainly scrapped our old color scheme because it was dull
 - This color scheme is a lot brighter and more vibrant really plaching emphasis on the useful functions in our code.
